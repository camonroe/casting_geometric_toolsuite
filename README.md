# Casting Geometric Toolsuite
A suite of tools for geometric analysis of metal castings.
Based on the work of William Warriner (paper references tbd).

# Analyses Available
- Feeders (geometry-based)
- Undercuts
- Non-slide cores (soluble cores in investment casting)
- Thin-wall (cavity and die/mold)
- Parting perimeter
- Waterfall (geometry-based)

# Planned Updates
- Simple graphical user interface for analysis
- Additional sample geometries
- Orientation optimization example
